# [LEGACY] Cute Difficulty Faces

Old TPs will continue to be maintained to function with GD, though these textures will recieve lower priority compared to the newer versions. 
If the game recieves an update and the textures become bugged, you're very welcome to [submit a new version](https://github.com/slackwaree/cute-difficulty-faces-legacy/issues/new) before I do!

The newer, more modernized versions of this texture pack can be found [here](https://github.com/slackwaree/cute-difficulty-faces).
